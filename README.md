- When a commit is made to the master branch, the app is automatically built on a Heroku staging application pending admin review.
- On successful testing the admin can promote the staging application to a Heroku production app through the Heroku dashboard
- Automated testing is done through Travis CI before locally changed code is accepted onto the repo.

User files are hosted on an AWS S3 bucket
